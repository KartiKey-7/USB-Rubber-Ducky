Insert the USB Rubber Ducky into the Windows 10 or Windows 11 machine. The device automatically begins executing the payload in 8–10 seconds. The script launches PowerShell in hidden mode and collects Chrome user-data files such as bookmarks, history, cookies and the login-database structure for audit and analysis. All collected files are copied into a temporary folder created by the payload, making them easy to review later. After collection, the payload generates a simple report and completes its execution without requiring user interaction. Open the output folder to review the gathered files for red-team demonstrations, forensic learning or system-configuration analysis.
